Halide Applications template
==============================

## Compiling and running
You need environment variable HALIDE_DIR to point to the base of Halide directory that contains include and lib directories. The `Makefile` in `my_app` should build everything and place the executables in bin.

***
## TODO

- [ ] Create template app source/main
- [ ] Create separate JIT, static test templates
